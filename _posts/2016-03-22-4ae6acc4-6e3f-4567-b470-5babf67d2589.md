Fabregas le métis noir is the new voice from Kinshasa. His song 'Mascara' raises awareness of HIV Aids. Fabrice Mbuyulu got nicknamed Fàbregas when he came to a rehearsal wearing an Arsenal shirt, that of football player Cesc Fabregas (currently playing for Chelsea). He added 'le Métis noir', „the black half-caste", as his skin tone is much lighter, compared to other people from Kinshasa, although he doesn't uses any bleaching cream.
